# A Diaspora pod on CentOS 7 with PostgreSQL
#
# Based on:
# https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Installation/CentOS/7?db=postgres&mode=production
#
# Please note that at the time of this writing Diaspora deployment was not very
# mature yet and the author of this script is unfamiliar with Ruby. This is not
# a robust solution as it stands today.
# However, this is open source so feel free to make it better!
